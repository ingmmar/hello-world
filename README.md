# hello-world
i'm ingmmar, interested in branching into coding. so far i've studied only on my own, but i hope to get enrolled in programming school in about a year. in the meantime, i'm studing machining, though currently i'm switching to mechatronics, as i feel i have the capacity to tackle on something more abstract while still technical, since my engineering studies weren't satysfying.
